i am get-to-the-ship game program, i say:

i only have black color for lines and words on white canvas, my main color is white
i only have plain canvas and one namespace - main
my repl is basic text area with no formatting
i only have canvas and repl, my repl is one line
i use no libraries - only swing textarea and canvas
i use one thread
my window has fixed size and is no more than a third of screen
my map is not tiles, but clear space
i use coordinates and distances
player has four heroes, their goal is to get to the ship
i spawn ship randomly on the map, far from where i spawn heroes
i show players the whole map from start

my world is this:

several heroes from different planents acciednetally unite (with their own motives) but end up looking for the vitaal ship
when they find it, with high hopes, there is a lost-hope vitaal there who tells that vitaal dismatled, and are mostly a myth now

heroes

one from sandy desert planet with traditions and customs suffocating and forceful, she disobeys her family and has to journey through the desert to fly off the planet
one a highly positioned kind-spirited long-time civil officer who seeks change on a feeling, he's having is empty
one a no-fear no-doubt adventurous hero who gets into trouble and just happens to bump into others, he does not seek or want to go, but gets curious and goes
one a doubtful, thinking, quite guy from a rocky rainy planet with no access to galactic net, he built the droid who was able to listen to frequencies, he learned about the vitaal ship and goes searching
