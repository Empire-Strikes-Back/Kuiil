i am Get-To-The-Ship program, i say:

i have only back-and-white canvas and repl
my repl is clojure repl
my repl swing text area, input is one line
i do not limit or alter player eval in any way - my repl is complete unabridged access to me as program
my window is fixed size and is no more that third of screen
i have no settings
player sees me in my entirety within window, no scrolling
player sees me in my entirety from start, all revealed
i am simple, i have few details
i have no time
i have no tiles, coordinates or distances
i have no concept of money or fight for resources
when it's hero's turn, i show their name and others - as dots (the map as hero's party sees it)

my world is this:

El, Ar, Bib and Cee coincidentally turn up on one of newer planets, each as part of their own separate party, uncoordinated
El aboard of research ship
Cee aboard transport ship
Ar aboard construction ship
Bib aboard racing ship

one - El - comes from a sandy planet with traditions so suffocating she chooses to leave - she disobeys her family and has to run days through desert to fly off planet
one - Cee - is an older civil officer who has his life set but realizes it's empty and seeks something he does not know yet, he leaves the service and joins a ship as a crew
one - Bib - leaves his successful education path chosen for him and follows his own dream - joins endurance racing ship as least team member
one - Ar - comes from a grey rocky isolated planet on the outskirts, he builds receiver to listen to galactic frequencies and learns about the ship, he sets off to find it

heroes never programmed before, but face challenges on their way they have to program - they learn as they go:

El has to assemble and program an out-of-order ship she finds to take off from her planet
Ar builds and programs receiver to connect to galactic internet
Cee lies that he can and joins a ship crew as engineer - he has to learn to program transport ship's systems
Bib programs ship systems and droids as part of the racing ship team
